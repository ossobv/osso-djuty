        Obtain an exclusive lock. This is reduced to a no-op.

        According to:
        - https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/12118 sharing of the
          in-memory DB between threads is illegal
        - we use an in-memory DB for tests
        - the locking strategies as outlined in several places have
          unintented side-effects

        Django already locks the entire file when loading a DB upon
        connect, so we could probably do without this locking entirely.
